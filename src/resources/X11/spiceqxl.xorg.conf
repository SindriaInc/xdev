    # Buffer Size notes:
    #  The following buffer sizes are used for Xspice only
    #  If you are using the DFPS mode, surface ram is not used,
    #  and you can set it to 1.
    #  Otherwise, the surface buffer should be at least as large
    #   as the frame buffer, and probably a multiple like 8.
    #  The command buffer ram should also be substantially larger
    #   than the frame buffer, and note that the frame buffer occupies
    #   the front of the command buffer.  Hence, our default size
    #   is a command buffer 7x the size of the frame buffer.
    #  If you see 'Out of memory' errors in your xorg.log, you probably need
    #   to increase the surface or command buffer sizes.
